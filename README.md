If you want automatic email sending:

1. Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create an account
2. Choose **"Personal Service"** (not Transactional)
3. Connect your Gmail, Outlook, or other email
4. Create an email template with variables:
   - `to_email`
   - `to_name`
   - `from_name`
   - `from_email`
   - `subject`
   - `message`
   - `signing_link`
5. Create a `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
